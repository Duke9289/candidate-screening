# Thank You For Your Interest In CyberFortress

If you're reading this, our company has definitely piqued your interest. 
We're glad you have made it this far and we hope to get to know you more!
Please follow the instructions to submit your application.

As per our [culture](https://www.cyberfortress.com/about/culture/), 
we base all merit upon what you are capable of and not upon
any certifications or education. Being counter-culture, consider this your
resume. Given that, we thought that this would 
be a creative way to express that and allow you, the applicant, 
to express yourself. 

## Instructions

Fork this repository and follow the scenario below.
The user data is located in `dataset.csv`.
Be sure to meet all the objectives.
When you are finished, open a PR against this repository and we will review
it and reach out to you via PR comments.
Take as long as you need. 
We prefer quality work even if it takes extra time.

## Scenario

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build an API which, 
given a user's unique identifier, should tell us whether it is raining
in the location where the user lives.

Unfortunately addresses are Personally Identifiable Information and
we don't want to expose that information to anyone. 

This is where your API comes in. We need you to store all of that information
in a database that *isn't* accessible by anything or anyone other than your 
service.

### Tools

You are free to use any language or tools you desire. Just be aware that
we are a Go, Python, and JavaScript shop currently, but we aren't afraid
of using different tech given the proper circumstances.

Use any weather API of your choosing.

### Objectives

* Under no circumstances should any of the users information be publicly
available.

* Your project must be tested with at least 80% branch coverage.

* Your storage engine _must_ be a database. Which flavor is up to you.

* We must be able to run the service locally.

## Bonus Points

* Docker

* Kubernetes

* Docker Compose

* Terraform

* Any CI/CD solution

* A web based user interface

* Scrape [randomlists.com](https://www.randomlists.com/random-addresses) to 
    generate your own user dataset. (Please scrape responsibly. 
    Don't scrape too much or too often)
